			<h3> What is DrugThatGene? </h3>
			DrugBuddy is a a web-based application to automate the analysis of potential therapeutic targets and/or therapeutic pathways identified from functional genetic screens. DTG integrates data from human genetic databases and small molecule databases. 
			
			<h3> Usage </h3>
			(1) Copy and paste a list of official gene symbols (https://www.genenames.org/) for human genes separated by spaces or on individual lines into the gene list field. The input is case insensitive and duplicate entries will be excluded. 
			<br>
			(2) Enter a number (for example "2", but not "two") to set the number of genes in a pathway required for the software to identify a "common pathway". 
			<br>
			(3) Click the "Submit" button
			<br>
			(4) The analysis will be output with two tables: "Druggable Genes" and "Druggable Pathways"
			<br>
			(5) To download the analyses in .csv format, click "Download Druggable Gene Analysis" and/or "Download Druggable Pathway Analysis"
			<br>
			(6) Entered genes that are not Official Gene Symbols (refer to the HGNC database: https://www.genenames.org/) are excluded from analysis. To download a list of genes that were excluded from the analysis for this reason, click "Download Genes Missing from Analysis"
			
			<h3> Example Data </h3>
			Top 100 genes from Riger analysis from genome-wide CRISPR screen in A375 cells (replicate #1):&nbsp <a href="{{ url_for('example_one') }}">Download replicate #1 gene list</a><br>
			Top 100 genes from Riger analysis from genome-wide CRISPR screen in A375 cells (replicate #2):&nbsp <a href="{{ url_for('example_two') }}">Download replicate #2 gene list</a><br> 
			<br>
			Riger analyses are from: Shalem, O., Sanjana, N.E., Hartenian, E., Shi, X., Scott, D.A., Mikkelsen, T.S., Heckl, D., Ebert, B.L., Root, D.E., Doench, J.G., et al. (2014). Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells. Science 343, 84â€“87.
